## Contribute to Xamarin documentation

We welcome contributions from our community (users, customers, partners, employees outside Xamarin product units, etc.) as well as from employees working on Xamarin products. Read about the [**contribution process**](CONTRIBUTING.md), and identify which of these best fits your situation:

* **Community - minor updates**: If you are contributing minor updates out of the goodness of your heart, you can find the article in this repository, or visit the article on [https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin) and click the **Edit** link in the article that goes to the GitHub source. Then, just use the GitHub website to make your updates. Or, you are welcome to [fork the repository](CONTRIBUTING.md) and submit updates from your fork.

* **Community - new articles**: If you're part of the Xamarin community and you want to create a new article, you need to work with an employee to help bring that new content in through a combination of work in the public and private repository. Start by raising a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/xamarin-docs/issues) in this repository that outlines your proposed content.

* **Employees**: If you are a technical writer, program manager, or developer from the product team for a Xamarin product and it's your job to contribute to or author technical articles, you should use the private repository (https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/xamarin-docs-pr). If you are making substantial changes to an existing article, adding or changing images, or contributing a new article, you need to fork this repository, install Git, a markdown editor, and learn some git commands. See [the internal contributor's guide](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/?branch=master) for more information.
