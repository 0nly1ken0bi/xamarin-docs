This document provides a high-level of overview of new and updated
features in macOS Mojave for which Xamarin's preview release currently
provides C# bindings.

## Dark Mode

Dark mode is a system-wide dark theme in macOS Mojave that uses a dynamic,
dark grey color scheme to display user interface elements. It also
introduces new accent colors, color effects, and content tint colors to
help third-party apps look good no matter the user's color settings.

## Natural Language framework

The Natural Language framework enables applications to perform various
types of language analysis. For example, it can be used to identify parts
of speech and determine the language represented by a block of text.

## User Notifications framework

The User Notifications framework is included in macOS Mojave, changing
the APIs that Mac apps use to work with user notifications.
