# F&#35;

F# is an open-source, cross-platform, functional-first programming language for .NET.

F# combines the succinctness, expressivity, and composability of type-inferred functional programming, the
compile-time safety of strongly-typed code, and the runtime support, libraries, interoperability, tools, and object model
of .NET.

F# is available as a programming language to Xamarin users on all of the Xamarin-supported platforms: Android, macOS, and iOS.
