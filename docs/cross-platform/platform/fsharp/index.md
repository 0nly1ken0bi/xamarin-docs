# F&#35;

_F# is a strongly-typed functional programming language designed to run on .NET_

F# combines the succinctness, expressivity and
composability of type-inferred functional programming, the
compile-time safety of strongly-typed code, and the
runtime support, libraries, interoperability, tools, and object model
of .NET.

F# is now available "out of the box" as a programming language to Xamarin
	users on all of the Xamarin-supported platforms: Android,
	OS X, and iOS.
