# Team License Management

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information in this guide only applies to legacy Xamarin platform licenses, not MSDN licenses. MSDN license holders should refer to this [Licensing Options guide](~/cross-platform/get-started/requirements.md) instead.


## Inviting Team Members
If you have an empty Xamarin license seat, you can invite a team member to occupy it by following these steps:

1.  Login to the [subscription management page](https://store.xamarin.com/account/my/subscription) in your Xamarin Store Account. Here, you will see a list of your [current subscriptions](http://screencast.com/t/BdOamw5Z).
2.  After selecting the platform you wish to invite team-members to, you will see a [text field](http://screencast.com/t/APdCrwaN) to `invite developer by email`. Once you enter the e-mail address of the teammate you wish to invite, please select the [invite](http://screencast.com/t/vjQAIBpT) button next to the text field.

And that's it! Your team-member(s) should automatically receive an email with further instructions on how to accept the invitation to the subscription; or if they already have a Xamarin Store Account they also have the option of accepting the invite directly from their account page.

## Accepting Team Invitations
If you receive a team invitation, you have two options to accept it:

1.  You should receive an e-mail that includes a link to accept the invitation to the Team Subscription. (You might need to check your spam filter as well.) Please follow the directions in the email to get going. 

2.  Alternatively, you can login to your [Xamarin Store Account](http://store.xamarin.com/account/my/subscription) to accept your invitation. Active invitations will be shown at the top of the screen, with the choice to Accept or Reject the invitation.

Once you have accepted an invitation to a seat of the subscription, this should be reflected in both your own and your subscription managerâ€™s Xamarin Store Account page. If you run into any problems accepting the invitation, please check with your subscription manager to make sure they have your correct information on the active invite/seat.

To activate your workstation with the new subscription, please first ensure that you have installed the software from the [Downloads](https://store.xamarin.com/account/my/subscription/downloads) section of your [Xamarin Store Account](http://store.xamarin.com/account/my/subscription).
