# How do I change my account's email address?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide does not apply to most MSDN users because they are not required to own or log into Xamarin accounts unless using the [Xamarin Components store](https://components.xamarin.com/) or [Visual Studio for Mac](~/cross-platform/get-started/requirements.md).


To change the email address associated with your Xamarin account, please email [hello@xamarin.com](mailto:hello@xamarin.com) from the address associated with your Xamarin account and indicate the new address you'd like to use. If you are no longer able to send emails from the address affiliated with your account, please reach out to us and we'll work with you to get you up and running with your new address.
