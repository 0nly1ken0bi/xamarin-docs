# Xamarin.Forms Deployment and Testing

## [Performance](performance.md)

There are many techniques for increasing the performance of Xamarin.Forms apps. Collectively these techniques can greatly reduce the amount of work being performed by a CPU, and the amount of memory consumed by an application.

## [Automated Testing with Xamarin.UITest and App Center](uitest-and-test-cloud.md)

Xamarin Test Cloud's **UITest** component can be used with Xamarin.Forms to write UI tests to run in the cloud on hundreds of devices.
