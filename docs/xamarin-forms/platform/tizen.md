# Tizen .NET

_Tizen .NET allows you to develop applications for the Tizen operating system, which runs on Samsung devices, includes TVs, wearables, mobile devices, and other IoT devices._

Tizen .NET enables you to build .NET applications with Xamarin.Forms and the Tizen .NET framework. Xamarin.Forms allows you to easily create user interfaces, while the TizenFX API provides interfaces to the hardware that's found in modern TV, mobile, wearable, and IoT devices. For more information about Tizen .NET, see [Introduction to Tizen .NET Application](https://developer.tizen.org/development/training/.net-application).

Before you can start developing Tizen .NET applications, you must first setup your development environment. For more information, see [Installing Visual Studio Tools for Tizen](https://developer.tizen.org/development/visual-studio-tools-tizen/installing-visual-studio-tools-tizen).

For information about how to add Tizen .NET project to an existing Xamarin.Forms solution, see [Creating your First Tizen .NET Application](https://developer.tizen.org/development/training/.net-application/creating-your-first-tizen-.net-application).
