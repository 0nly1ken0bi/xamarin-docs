# iOS Platform Features

## iOS-specific Formatting

Xamarin.Forms enables cross-platform user interface styles and colors to
be set - but there are other options for setting the theme of your iOS
using platform-specific APIs in the iOS project.

[Read more](theme.md) about formatting the user interface using iOS-specific
APIs, such as **Info.plist** configuration and the `UIAppearance` API.

## iOS 9 Features

Using [custom renderers](~/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/custom-renderer/index.md),
the [DependencyService](~/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/dependency-service/index.md),
and the [MessagingCenter](~/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/messaging-center.md),
it's possible to incorporate a wide variety of native functionality
into Xamarin.Forms apps for iOS.

The following recipes show how to incorporate iOS 9 features into the
iOS part of a Xamarin.Forms app:
