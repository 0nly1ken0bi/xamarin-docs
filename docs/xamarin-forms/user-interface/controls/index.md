# Controls Reference

Xamarin.Forms uses
  use the native controls of each target platform.
  This means applications can use [Portable Class Libraries](~/cross-platform/app-fundamentals/pcl.md) or [Shared Projects](~/cross-platform/app-fundamentals/shared-projects.md)
  to house this shared code, and then make platform
  specific applications that will consume the shared code.

There are four main control groups used to create the user
  interface of a Xamarin.Forms application:

- [**Pages**](pages.md)
- [**Layouts**](layouts.md)
- [**Views**](views.md)
- [**Cells**](cells.md)

At runtime each
  control will be mapped to its native equivalent,
  which is what will be rendered.

This section serves as a reference showing many of
  the UI controls available for use with Xamarin.Forms,
  and is accompanied by the [FormsGallery sample](https://developer.xamarin.com/samples/FormsGallery/),
  which demonstrates a basic use of each control.
  Each description also links to
  the [API Documentation](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/namespace/Xamarin.Forms/).
