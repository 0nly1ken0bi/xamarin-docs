# Xamarin.Forms Gestures

_Gesture recognizers can be used to detect user interaction with many elements of a Xamarin.Forms application._

The Xamarin.Forms [`GestureRecognizer`](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/Xamarin.Forms.GestureRecognizer/) class supports tap, pinch, and pan gestures on user interface controls.

## [Adding a Tap Gesture Recognizer](tap.md)

The tap gesture is used for tap detection and is implemented with the [`TapGestureRecognizer`](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/Xamarin.Forms.TapGestureRecognizer/) class.

## [Adding a Pinch Gesture Recognizer](pinch.md)

The pinch gesture is used for performing interactive zoom and is implemented with the [`PinchGestureRecognizer`](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/Xamarin.Forms.PinchGestureRecognizer/) class.

## [Adding a Pan Gesture Recognizer](pan.md)

The pan gesture is used for detecting dragging and is implemented with the [`PanGestureRecognizer`](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/type/Xamarin.Forms.PanGestureRecognizer/) class.
