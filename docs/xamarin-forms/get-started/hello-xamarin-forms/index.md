# Hello, Xamarin.Forms

_This guide provides an introduction to developing a Xamarin.Forms application using Visual Studio for Mac or Visual Studio, and to the fundamentals of application development using Xamarin.Forms. Topics covered include the tools, concepts, and steps required to build and deploy a Xamarin.Forms application._

Start by reviewing the [Xamarin.Forms System Requirements](~/cross-platform/get-started/installation/index.md).

## [Part 1: Quickstart](~/xamarin-forms/get-started/hello-xamarin-forms/quickstart.md)

The first part of this guide demonstrates how to create an application that translates an alphanumeric phone number entered by the user into a numeric phone number, and then calls that number.

## [Part 2: Deep Dive](~/xamarin-forms/get-started/hello-xamarin-forms/deepdive.md)

The second part of this guide reviews what has been built, to develop an understanding of the fundamentals of how Xamarin.Forms applications work.
