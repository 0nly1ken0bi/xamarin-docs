# Get Started with Xamarin.Forms

_Xamarin.Forms is a cross-platform UI toolkit that allows developers to efficiently create native user interface layouts that can be shared across iOS, Android, and Universal Windows Platform apps. This series introduces the basics of Xamarin.Forms development and covers building multi-platform and multi-screen applications._

For an overview of the installation and setup practices that apply to cross-platform development, see [Xamarin.Forms Requirements](installation.md) and [Installation](~/cross-platform/get-started/installation/index.md).
