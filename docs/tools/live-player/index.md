# Xamarin Live Player for Xamarin.Forms

The Xamarin Live Player helps you get started with Xamarin.Forms development by learning to build mobile apps that you can test on your Android or iOS device. Your code runs inside the Xamarin Live Player app â€“ there is no need to set up emulators or to use cables to deploy the code! To get started, download the Xamarin Live Player, pair it to Visual Studio, and deploy your code, and test the app. 

The Xamarin Live Player is designed as a getting started sandbox for developers to get their ideas visualized on a device quickly. Since the source code is interpreted you may reach the [limitations](limitations.md) after some time and need to fully compile your app for device or emulator.
