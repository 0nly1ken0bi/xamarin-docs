 > [!VIDEO https://youtube.com/embed/zGTfboTQLfo]

**Physics and collision detection in UrhoSharp, by [Xamarin University](https://university.xamarin.com)**

The video covers the creation of a simple 3D scene, shows how to assign physical aspects to objects and how to visualize them, using these [UrhoTest workbooks](https://github.com/Krumelur/UrhoTest). It also explains the techniques required to detect collisions between objects and how to run asynchronous animations.

## [PropertyAnimation.workbook](https://developer.xamarin.com/workbooks/android/user-interface/PropertyAnimation.workbook)
