# Xamarin Workbooks

Xamarin Workbooks provide a blend of documentation and code that is perfect for
experimentation, learning, and creating guides and teaching aids.

Create a rich C# workbook for Android, iOS, Mac, WPF, or Console, and get instant live
results as you learn these APIs.

Xamarin Workbooks is open source software. Development happens in the open
on GitHub. We invite interested users and developers to get involved with the
project.
