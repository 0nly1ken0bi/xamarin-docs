# Hello, Android Multiscreen

_In this two-part guide, you expand the Phoneword application that you created in the Hello, Android guide to handle a second screen. Along the way, this guide will introduce the basic Android Application Building Blocks and dive deeper into Android architecture as you develop a better understanding of Android application structure and functionality._

##  [Part 1: Quickstart](~/android/get-started/hello-android-multiscreen/hello-android-multiscreen-quickstart.md)

In the first part of this guide, you'll add a second screen to the
Phoneword application to keep track of the history of numbers called
from the app. The final app will display a second screen that lists
the call history.

##  [Part 2: Deep Dive](~/android/get-started/hello-android-multiscreen/hello-android-multiscreen-deepdive.md)

In the second part of this document, you will review what you've built
and discusses architecture, navigation, and other new Android concepts
that are encountered along the way.
