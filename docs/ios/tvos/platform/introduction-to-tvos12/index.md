This document provides a high-level overview of new and updated tvOS 12
features for which Xamarin's preview release currently provides C# bindings.

## Password AutoFill

With tvOS 12, users can use their iOS devices to sign in to a tvOS app with
a single tap. This is enabled through a combination of `UITextContentType`
usage to specify username and password fields, associated domains to
establish a relationship between an iOS app and a tvOS app, and preferred
focus environments to select an item to receive focus after a user
provides a username and password.

## Focus Engine enhancements

tvOS 12 allows all apps, no matter how they are rendered, to interact
with the Focus Engine. Through a user's interactions with the Siri
Remote, the Focus Engine can be used with any app to select an item, hint
at possible focus changes, and naturally update focus. This is enabled in
custom applications through UIKit's `IUIFocusItemContainer` interface,
the `UIFocusMovementHint` class, the `IUIFocusItemScrollableContainer`
interface, and other related classes and methods.
