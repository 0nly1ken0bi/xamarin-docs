# Installing tvOS Support

Apple has released the Apple TV 4K and tvOS 11. The Apple TV platform is open to developers, allowing them to create rich, immersive apps and release them through the Apple TV's built-in App Store.

## Xamarin.tvOS

To get started using Xamarin to develop apps for tvOS, install the latest version of Xamarin.iOS in Visual Studio for Mac or Visual Studio 2015 or 2017 on Windows.  

Xamarin.iOS 11 and later support the tvOS 11 SDK that ships with Apple's Xcode 9.

## Installing tvOS Support

To install Xamarin.tvOS:

1. **Install the latest Xcode** – [Download the latest version of Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/) and install it. Without Xcode installed, it will not be possible to build Xamarin apps. 
2. **Run Xcode** – After installing Xcode, start it once before updating and running Visual Studio for Mac. Xcode will install some tools that Xamarin requires.
3. **Install the latest stable Xamarin release** - Update to the latest [stable Xamarin release](https://developer.xamarin.com/recipes/cross-platform/ide/change_updates_channel/).

You are now ready to create Xamarin.tvOS apps.
