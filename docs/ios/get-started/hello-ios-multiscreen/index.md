# Hello, iOS Multiscreen

##  [Part 1: Quickstart](~/ios/get-started/hello-ios-multiscreen/hello-ios-multiscreen-quickstart.md)

In the first part of this guide we’ll add a second screen to our Phoneword application to keep track of the history of numbers called using our app.

##  [Part 2: Deep Dive](~/ios/get-started/hello-ios-multiscreen/hello-ios-multiscreen-deepdive.md)



In the second part of this document, we’ll review what we’ve built and discuss architecture, navigation, and other new iOS concepts that we encounter along the way.
