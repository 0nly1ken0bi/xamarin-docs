This document provides a high-level description of some watchOS 5 APIs
for which Xamarin's preview release provides C# bindings.

## Shortcuts on the Siri watch face

In watchOS 5, the Siri watch face shows shortcuts that surface app content
and functionality to users at convenient times. Siri learns over time to
show relevant shortcuts when they are most likely to be used.

## Movement Disorder API

The Movement Disorder API, part of the CoreMotion framework in watchOS 5,
allows watchOS applications to monitor, record, and query tremor and
dyskinesia symptoms related to Parkinson's disease.
