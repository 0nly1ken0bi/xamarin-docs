# API

Xamarin.iOS exposes a C#/CIL binding to the CocoaTouch API and also provides
access to the ECMA CIL APIs and various other .NET APIs.

 **API Reference**: The API reference is available at [https://developer.xamarin.com/api/](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/), start at the [Xamarin.iOS Framework node](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/root/ios-unified/) for the API bindings for the native iPhone
APIs or go to [Base Class Libraries node](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/root/classlib/) for documentation on the .NET
API.

 **API Design**: The API design for the CIL/Objective-C binding
is covered in the [Xamarin.iOS API Design](~/ios/internals/api-design/index.md) document and it describes how we bound the Objective-C and C APIs
from CocoaTouch and exposed those to the C#/CIL world.

 **Assemblies**: Check our [list of bound assemblies](~/cross-platform/internals/available-assemblies.md) for a detailed
reference of which APIs from C#/CIL/ECMA are available for use on Xamarin.iOS.
