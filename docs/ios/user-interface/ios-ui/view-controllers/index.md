# View Controllers

## [View Controller Transitions](transitions.md)

UIKit adds support for customizing the animated transition that occurs when presenting view controllers. This support is included with built-in controllers, as well as any custom controllers that inherit directly from `UIViewController`. Additionally, `UICollectionViewController` takes advantage of controller transition customization to leverage the animated transitions in collection view layouts.
