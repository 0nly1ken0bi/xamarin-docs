CCDrawNode provides methods for drawing primitive objects such as lines, circles, and triangles.



## [Animating with CCAction](~/graphics-games/cocossharp/ccaction.md)

![](images/ccaction.png "CCAction is a base class which can be used to animate CocosSharp objects")

`CCAction` is a base class which can be used to animate CocosSharp objects. This guide covers built-in `CCAction` implementations for common tasks such as positioning, scaling, and rotating. It also looks at how to create custom implementations by inheriting from `CCAction`.



## [Using Tiled with CocosSharp](~/graphics-games/cocossharp/tiled.md)

Tiled is a powerful, flexible, and mature application for creating orthogonal and isometric tile maps for games. CocosSharp provides built-in integration for Tiled’s native file format.



##  [Entities in CocosSharp](~/graphics-games/cocossharp/entities.md)

![](images/entities.png "The entity pattern is a powerful way to organize game code")

The entity pattern is a powerful way to organize game code. It improves readability, makes code easier to maintain, and leverages built-in parent/child functionality.



##  [Handling Multiple Resolutions in CocosSharp](~/graphics-games/cocossharp/resolutions.md)

![](images/resolutions.png "This guide shows how to work with CocosSharp to develop games that display properly on devices of varying resolutions")

This guide shows how to work with CocosSharp to develop games that display properly on devices of varying resolutions.



##  [CocosSharp Content Pipeline](~/graphics-games/cocossharp/content-pipeline/index.md)

![](images/content-pipeline.png "Content Pipelines are often used in game development to optimize content and format")

Content Pipelines are often used in game development to optimize content and format it such that it can be loaded on certain hardware or with certain game development frameworks.



## [Improving Framerate with CCSpriteSheet](~/graphics-games/cocossharp/ccspritesheet.md)

![](images/ccspritesheet.png "CCSpriteSheet provides functionality for combining and using many image files in one texture")

`CCSpriteSheet` provides functionality for combining and using many image files in one texture. Reducing texture count can improve a game’s load times and framerate.



## [Texture Caching using CCTextureCache](~/graphics-games/cocossharp/texture-cache.md)

![](images/texture-cache.png "CocosSharp’s CCTextureCache class provides a standard way to organize, cache, and unload content")

CocosSharp’s CCTextureCache class provides a standard way to organize, cache, and unload content. 



## [2D Math with CocosSharp](~/graphics-games/cocossharp/math.md)

![](images/math.png "This guide covers 2D mathematics for game development")

This guide covers 2D mathematics for game development. It uses CocosSharp to show how to perform common game development tasks and explains the math behind these tasks.



## [Performance and Visual Effects with CCRenderTexture](~/graphics-games/cocossharp/ccrendertexture.md)

![](images/ccrendertexture.png "The CCRenderTexture class provides functionality for rendering multiple CocosSharp objects to a single texture")

The `CCRenderTexture` class provides functionality for rendering multiple CocosSharp objects to a single texture. Once created, `CCRenderTexture` instances can be used to render graphics efficiently and to implement visual effects.
