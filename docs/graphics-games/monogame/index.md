# Monogame

MonoGame is an efficient, flexible, cross platform API for developing 2D and 3D games. It provides the foundation for many cross-platform game engines, but can be used directly in games without being wrapped in a game engine.

MonoGame is a cross-platform, hardware accelerated API providing graphics, audio, game state management, input, and a content pipeline for importing assets.

## [3D Graphics with MonoGame](~/graphics-games/monogame/3d/index.md)

MonoGame offers a flexible, efficient API for displaying real-time 3D graphics. It includes higher-level constructs for rendering and also access to lower-level graphics resources.

## [MonoGame GamePad Reference](~/graphics-games/monogame/input.md)

GamePad is a standard, cross-platform class for accessing input devices in MonoGame.

## [MonoGame Platform Specific Considerations](~/graphics-games/monogame/platforms/index.md)
